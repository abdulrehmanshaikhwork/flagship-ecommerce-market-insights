## 📊 Real-world data → business-ready insights using Python analytics

## 🧠 Project Overview

This is my flagship data analytics project, built to simulate a real-world business analysis workflow:

Web Scraping → Data Cleaning → Feature Engineering → Exploratory Data Analysis → Insights

The dataset contains real product listings from an e-commerce platform, including:

• Price
• Star Rating
• Discount %
• Engineered Price Category

The goal was to understand how price, discounting, and perceived value shape customer ratings and market positioning.

---

## 🎯 Key Questions Explored

✔ Which price ranges dominate the market?
✔ Do higher-priced products receive better ratings?
✔ Do discounts influence ratings?
✔ How do ratings vary across price categories?
✔ Is the market price-sensitive or value-driven?

---

## 🛠 Tools Used

Python · BeautifulSoup · Pandas · NumPy · Matplotlib · Seaborn · Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Below are the key visualizations and insights generated in the notebook.

---

### 1️⃣ Market Price Distribution

#### 🔍 Insight

The market shows a right-skewed price distribution:

Most products are priced in the lower to mid-range

A few very expensive products stretch the tail upward

➡️ This indicates a price-sensitive market driven by affordable offerings.

---

### 2️⃣ Number of Products per Price Category

#### 🔍 Insight

Most products belong to the:

🔥 Budget & Mid Price Categories

Premium and Luxury categories exist — but represent smaller market shares.

➡️ This shows where companies compete most aggressively.

---

### 3️⃣ Price vs Star Rating

#### 🔍 Insight

Customer ratings remain consistently high across price levels:

✔ Budget products still achieve 4★+ ratings
✔ Premium pricing does not automatically guarantee higher ratings

➡️ Satisfaction is not purely price-driven.

---

### 4️⃣ Price vs Rating (with Trend Line)

#### 🔍 Insight

A slight positive trend exists — meaning Premium products rate slightly higher —
but the relationship remains weak overall.

➡️ Customers judge value & experience, not just cost.

---

### 5️⃣ Discount vs Rating

#### 🔍 Insight

There is no clear relationship between discount percentage and rating.

➡️ Discounts help sales conversions —
but do not improve long-term product perception.

---

### 6️⃣ Average Star Rating by Price Category

#### 🔍 Insight

All price categories show high customer satisfaction, with only a small increase at higher price tiers.

➡️ Value perception exists across all segments.

---

### 7️⃣ Customer Rating Distribution

#### 🔍 Insight

Most ratings fall between 4.2–4.6, revealing:

✔ Positive review bias
✔ Customers review more when satisfied

➡️ This aligns with common marketplace behavior.

---

## 🧠 Final Business Summary

“Our analysis shows that while Premium products have slightly higher ratings on average, Price is not a strong driver of customer satisfaction. Customers evaluate overall Value — including performance, reliability, usability, and experience — rather than price alone. Discounts also do not significantly influence ratings, indicating that promotions may boost short-term sales conversions but do not improve long-term product perception.”
